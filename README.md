## Introduction

The I Ching or Book of Changes is an ancient Chinese book with a number of
existing translations.

The I Ching as translated from the Chinese into German by Richard Wilhelm and
rendered into English by Cary F. Baynes (1950) has become a well respected
classic. It is available as a printed book by the Bollingen Foundation published
by Princeton University Press. The book includes a Foreward by C. G. Jung, the
text of the I Ching and additional materials discussing the history, the
Trigrams, the underlying principles, and the Commentaries.

## Origin and purpose of this project

The purpose of this project is to provide an electronic version of the text
related to the hexagrams, as found in the first part of the Wilhelm/Baynes
translation, and to provide a pdf version that can be downloaded for offline use
on a mobile phone or ebook reader.

It is available as a git repository to allow for corrections and improvements.

The project is a further adaptation of the work presented on the website
[deYoung I Ching Wilhelm Translation](http://www2.unipr.it/~deyoung/I_Ching_Wilhelm_Translation.html)

The translation is also available on other websites. For example it is found at
[I Ching - The Translation](https://aspectsoftao.net/iching/translation.html)

## Features of this project

In this project the text from the previously noted website was used as a
starting point and has been improved with corrections including: typos,
occasional omissions, incorrect references, and removal of duplicated phrases.

The index table has been enhanced and appears similar to that found in the book
with the names of the trigrams and the symbolic representations. The trigram
images have also been added to each hexagram as they appear in the book.

Appendices have also been added. First, the appendix "Consulting the Oracle" as
found in the book has been added including "The Yarrow Stalk Oracle" and
"The Coin Oracle". The section on moving lines giving rise to a new hexagram is
specifically highlighted as it is essential to understanding how to use the
oracle.

A new appendix, not found in the book by Wilhelm and Baynes, has been added that
explores the "Mathematical Analysis & Alternate Coin Method".

## Usefulness of pdf version

During the creation of this project it was noted that a pdf version offers the
usefulness of providing a single file with active hyperlinks, like the web page,
that can be stored locally on a computer or mobile device for easy reference.

A pdf file can be created from the web page however for this to work correctly
with hyperlinks that resolve to the target sections in the pdf document it may
be necessary to use the Chrome browser with the Print and "Save to PDF"
function. To ensure a pdf file is created that can be easily read on a small
device like a phone the html document uses the CSS @page element specifying a
narrow page width. A longer than usual page length is used to ensure the index
table rows are not separated.

A copy of the pdf file has been added to the project to allow easy downloads.

## What happened to citations of Goethe in the German translation?

In a forum post on the Internet someone notes:

[Wilhelm's German Translation of the I Ching](https://www.onlineclarity.co.uk/friends/index.php?threads/wilhelms-german-translation-of-the-i-ching.15901/post-166444https://www.onlineclarity.co.uk/friends/index.php?threads/wilhelms-german-translation-of-the-i-ching.15901/post-166444)

It would certainly be interesting to see the citations of Goethe that Richard
Wilhelm included in his German Translation of the I Ching.

## Future Enhancements - A gender neutral version

The I Ching or Book of Changes is an ancient Chinese book that provides wisdom
and guidance for all time. However, some people may find it is not easy for
them to relate to it because of the gender references in phrases, such as
"the superior man", and references to the roles of men and women as existed in
ancient times, and also the gender pronouns used throughout the text.

This raises a thought that if the text is transformed into a gender neutral
version it may be better appreciated by more people. However, such an
undertaking will no doubt take much effort and consideration. This project may
provide for such an effort through a fork of the git repository.

The End.
