  <h1>I Ching Wilhelm Baynes Translation</h1>
  <p>The I Ching or Book of Changes is an ancient Chinese book with a number of
    existing translations.</p>
  <p>The I Ching as translated from the Chinese into German by Richard Wilhelm
    and rendered into English by Cary F. Baynes (1950) has become a well
    respected classic. It is available as a printed book by the Bollingen
    Foundation published by Princeton University Press. The book includes a
    Foreward by C.G. Jung, the text of the I Ching and additional materials
    discussing the history, the Trigrams, the underlying principles, and the
    Commentaries.</p>
  <p>This project provides an electronic version of the text related to the
    hexagrams, as found in the first part of the Wilhelm/Baynes translation,
    that can be viewed online as html or pdf. The pdf file can also be
    downloaded for offline use on a mobile phone or ebook reader.</p>

  <p>The project is available in a public git repository, at
    <a href="https://github.com/clovemedia/i_ching">https://github.com/clovemedia/i_ching</a>,
    to allow for corrections and improvements. For discussions go to
    <a href="https://github.com/clovemedia/i_ching/discussions">https://github.com/clovemedia/i_ching/discussions</a>.</p>
  <p>It includes an index table similar to that found in the book with the names
    of the trigrams and their symbolic representations with a hyperlink to the
    section of the document pertaining to each hexagram.</p>
  <p>It also includes the appendix "Consulting the Oracle" as found in the book
    including "The Yarrow Stalk Oracle" and "The Coin Oracle". The section on
    moving lines giving rise to a new hexagram is specifically highlighted as it
    is essential to understanding how to use the oracle.</p>
  <p>A new appendix, not found in the book by Wilhelm and Baynes, has been added
    that explores a mathematical analysis of the yarrow stalk oracle and use of
    three coins. An alternate method using two coins is described that emulates
    the probabilities of the yarrow stalk method. Details on this mathematical
    analysis were found at <a href="https://aleadeum.com/2013/07/12/the-i-ching-random-numbers-and-why-you-are-doing-it-wrong/">The I Ching random numbers</a>
    along with a variety of comments.</p>

  <h2>What happened to citations of Goethe in the German translation?</h2>
  <p>In a forum post on the Internet someone notes:</p>
  <blockquote><p>One thing, among a few, that has always bothered me about the
    Baynes English translation (of Wilhelm's I Ching) was his decision to remove
    all of the latter's citations of Goethe; and at this late stage in time, I
    have pretty much given up all hope of ever seeing a new English translation
    of Wilhelm's German edition, though I believe one is more than warranted.</p>
    <p> Yen Hui (  <a href="https://www.onlineclarity.co.uk/friends/index.php?threads/wilhelms-german-translation-of-the-i-ching.15901/post-166444https://www.onlineclarity.co.uk/friends/index.php?threads/wilhelms-german-translation-of-the-i-ching.15901/post-166444">Wilhelm's German Translation of the I Ching</a>) </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>It would certainly be interesting to see the citations of Goethe that
    Richard Wilhelm included in his German Translation of the I Ching.</p>

  <h2>Would a gender neutral version be easier to relate to?</h2>
  <p>While the I Ching or Book of Changes is an ancient Chinese book that
    provides wisdom and guidance for all time, some people may find it is not
    easy for them to relate to it because of the gender references in phrases,
    such as "the superior man", and references to the roles of men and women as
    existed in ancient times, and also the gender pronouns used throughout the
    text.</p>
  <p>This raises a thought that if the text is transformed into a gender neutral
    version it may be better appreciated by more people. However, such an
    undertaking will no doubt take much effort and consideration. This project
    may provide for such an effort through a fork of the git repository.</p>
